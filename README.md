 Logging is the act of creating a record of an incident or action. It helps us keep track of the state of an application in application enviornments we can't analyze directly.In essence, a log file is a repository of records that document events transpiring during the execution of an application

Every node process has three default streams that it can work with, **stdin**, **stdout** and **stderr**.

* The **stdin** stream is handling the input that comes to your process. 
* The **stdout** stream is meant for your applicationâ€™s output. 
* The **stderr** is meant for error messages.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">A RESTful request is by definition stateless, i.e. each request must contain all of the information necessary to be understood by the server, rather than be dependent upon the server remembering prior requests. The server does not remember anything about the requester between requests.  

**Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client**
